// OPENDISPLAY_HAS_WIFI gates the entire WiFi/LAN transport surface (mDNS, TCP
// server, TLS-PSK listener, RX reassembly buffer, LAN response framing). It is
// defined only on ESP32 targets built with -DOPENDISPLAY_ENABLE_WIFI, which is
// applied to every S3, C6, and C3 platformio env (esp32-s3-E1004 sets no flag of
// its own but inherits it from esp32-s3-N32R8-extuart). TWO classic-ESP32 envs lack
// it -- esp32-N4 and esp32-wrover-e-N4R8 -- so neither compiles the WiFi surface,
// and both reclaim the 16 KB RX buffer + WiFiServer/WiFiClient RAM. Note
// esp32-wrover-e-N4R8 is NOT in platformio.ini's default_envs, so a bare `pio run`
// skips it: it ships via .github/firmware-targets.json, and it is the target most
// likely to catch a broken #ifndef OPENDISPLAY_HAS_WIFI path. Build it explicitly. Call sites in
// main.cpp / communication.cpp / display_service.cpp / device_control.cpp /
// config_parser.cpp are #ifdef-guarded on this macro.
