#include <stdint.h>

// Portable BLE link abstraction. Deliberately includes NO stack headers, so any
// translation unit can use it without dragging in Bluefruit or NimBLE types.
//
// Exactly one implementation is linked per build (ble_transport_nrf.cpp or
// ble_transport_esp32.cpp), so this is a plain class rather than an abstract
// base: virtual dispatch would cost a vtable and indirect calls for zero
// benefit, and application code would still only ever see one type.
//
// Threading, as of Phase 1: the callback contract is NOT yet symmetric. ESP32
// stack callbacks are flag-only (they copy into the RX ring and set a flag);
// nRF still dispatches commands inline on the SoftDevice callback task and runs
// the app connect/disconnect hooks there. Phase 3 makes nRF match ESP32. Until
// then the asymmetry lives entirely inside the two implementation files -- see
// docs/PLAN_BLE_TRANSPORT_ABSTRACTION_2026-07-27.md.
