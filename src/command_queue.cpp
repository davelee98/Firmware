// It lives here, not in either transport, because this is the one function both
// stack callbacks call -- ESP32's onWrite() and nRF's onWriteCb(). A copy in each
// callback is how the two targets drifted in the first place: ESP32 had a hex line
// and separate "too large" / "empty" warnings, nRF had neither and reported all
// three failures as "queue full", pointing at ring depth for what was actually a
// malformed frame.
//
// Logged at ARRIVAL, on the stack callback task, so the timestamp is when the radio
// delivered the frame rather than when loop() got to it -- that ordering is the
// point of the line, and it cannot be had from the consumer side. The cost used to
// be a blocking serial write (~9 ms for a full hex line at 115200) that delayed this
// callback task; as of the od_log rewrite it is a formatting cost plus a
// non-blocking write attempt, because od_log gives any task other than loop() a zero
// wait budget and discards the record rather than waiting above loop()'s priority.
// A frame's line can therefore be dropped under burst -- see the delivery contract
// in od_log.h. It is compiled out entirely at the default INFO level; only the
// -debug envs pay it, and only for frames the quiet predicate does not suppress.
//
// Depth is the PRE-push count, matching logTxFrame()'s pre-enqueue depth, so a
// healthy path reads [BLE][Q:0] and a rising Q means arrivals are outrunning
// loop()'s drain. RX is BLE-only by construction -- LAN frames reach the dispatcher
